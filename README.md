## 1. Setting up your environment.

We use docker, thus the dev-env is set up based on the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), the requirements are defined in the 
[requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). Please be aware that our env is based on the tf-jupyter Docker image, thus 
it van be considered as quite heavy, but since to solve the project we also would like to experiment with different 
models, approaches I chose this as my primary dev env.
